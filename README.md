## About

### Description and Purpose

**ArcForge** is a full-stack story planning web app that helps writers, game designers, and creative teams organize their story ideas in one place. Users can create story projects, add scenes, build character profiles, define locations, and connect characters to specific scenes. Instead of keeping ideas scattered across documents, notes, and spreadsheets, ArcForge gives users a structured workspace for planning story timelines, tracking scene progress, and managing relationships between characters, locations, and story events.

The purpose of ArcForge is to make story development easier and more organized. It helps creators see how each scene fits into the larger story, which characters appear in each scene, where events take place, and what still needs to be completed. This is especially useful for people working on novels, short films, comics, visual novels, or story-driven games.

### Inspiration

ArcForge was inspired by the challenge of planning creative projects with many connected pieces. When building a story, it can be difficult to remember which characters appear in each scene, what role they play, where events happen, and whether each scene is still a draft or finished. Many creators use separate notes, documents, or spreadsheets, but those tools are not always designed for visualizing story structure.

We wanted to build an app that feels both creative and practical: something that gives storytellers a clean way to organize their ideas while also helping them track progress. ArcForge combines the structure of a project management tool with the creativity of a storyboarding workspace, making it useful for writers, student creators, game designers, and small creative teams.

### Character Profiles

Users can create and manage character profiles with details such as name, role, description, motivation, and notes. This helps creators keep character information organized instead of scattered across separate documents.

### Location Library

Users can create reusable story locations and connect scenes to those locations. This helps creators track where events happen and reuse important settings across multiple scenes.

### Scene Character Assignments

Users can assign multiple characters to a scene and describe each character's role in that scene. This feature demonstrates a many-to-many relationship between scenes and characters using a join table.

### Scene Filtering and Sorting

Users can filter or sort scenes by character, location, mood, status, or timeline order. This makes it easier to find specific story moments and review the structure of a project.

### Story Progress Overview

Users can view calculated story progress, such as how many scenes are completed compared to the total number of scenes. This gives creators a quick summary of how much planning work is finished.

### Dynamic Detail Pages

Users can navigate to individual story, scene, character, and location pages. These pages use dynamic React Router routes based on the selected item's ID.

Example routes include:

- `/projects/:projectId`

- `/projects/:projectId/scenes/:sceneId`

- `/characters/:characterId`

- `/locations/:locationId`

### Loading and Submission States

The app displays a loading spinner while retrieving data. Form inputs and submission buttons are temporarily disabled while a request is being processed to prevent duplicate submissions.

For example, a submit button may change from Save Scene to Saving... until the request is completed.
